    <p>I have just finished a case for a client who had originally hired one of those “large all-purpose Investigative firms”. They ended up charging him more for a mere 5 3/4hrs. of work than I charged him after solving his case. They provided him with no new information and did not achieve the results he wanted. If you’re having infidelity issues with your spouse or significant other give us a call at Stealth Private Investigations <a href="tel:+13143297151">314-329-7151</a>.</p>

  title: "Retainers"

    <p>As stated in PI Magazine,
    <blockquote>"It's common for private investigators to have clients sign a PI Retainer Agreement before commencing any investigation. A Retainer Agreement protects both the client and the investigator. It should clearly state what services the investigator is being hired to perform, at what rate, and detail all the terms and conditions pertaining to the investigation. The Retainer Fee represents the budget you have allocated for the investigation and investigators will usually never commence work without a retainer. The main product/service investigators provide is information. As such, the retainer allows for the investigator to provide the client with the information developed without fear of not getting paid."</blockquote>

    <p>You may be asking yourself, "Why do I need to hire a PI or Private Investigator?"</p>
    <p>
      Private Investigators are very familiar with the art of undercover and surveillance work.  You may be putting yourself in danger if you try to perform your own investigation. Tailing and surveillance may put you in areas where it’s not safe at night or even in the day for that matter. You’re very likely to blow your cover, especially if you’re known by the person you’re surveilling. This too can be dangerous if that person is of a violent nature. If they notice you they can call the police and have you arrested for stalking. Private investigators aren’t arrested for stalking, that’s their job, and the law knows there’s no harm intended. You also have to know the laws, you can’t just go around videoing someone and expect it to hold up in court. Or if you got the video in an illegal way you may be the one that’s in court defending yourself. There are many other reasons why you need to hire a PI but I’ll get into them at a later time. Play it safe and hire a PI.

      Hiring a licensed private investigator is important for many reasons one of which is the CPE required by the state of Missouri for it's investigators. I have just finished my 16 hours of training for this time period. This year I restudied "Ethics" and "Surveillance".

      It’s wise to hire a PI for infidelity/adultery cases. Several of my clients have revealed their suspicions of infidelity to their partner making it much more difficult to find out what they are doing. Believe me, you cannot tail someone in your car without them seeing you or you getting a ticket. If you did happen to see who they are with you won’t be able to find out who that person is without giving yourself away. You won’t be able to get a background check on the person. I’ve had client’s locations and conversations monitored because their partner new they were under suspicion. This makes an investigation more difficult and expensive. The bottom line is, hire a PI to get the facts and put your mind at ease.

      PI Magazine just published an interesting article about online investigative sites. Clients were using them disrupting investigations and getting bogus information. They compared databases restricted to investigators with sites like <em>PeopleFinder</em>, <em>Intellius</em>, and <em>BeenVerified</em. The results were downright sad. One investigator found out his mother was still alive three years after he had buried her. It told a lot more but the bottom line is the online sites are not accurate. They can lead you down the wrong path and possibly cause you to make some wrong decisions.
