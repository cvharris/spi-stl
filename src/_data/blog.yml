  title: "Technology and Infidelity"

    <p>As technology improves infidelity becomes more prevalent.  In the past a board, unhappy spouse would need to have a cheating situation just drop into their lap or they would have to go out to bars or gyms to hunt for someone to cheat with.  They would have to feel someone out, read their reactions to see if they are of a like mind to cheat.  It was more difficult and thus a spouse that wanted to cheat had to go out of their way to make it happen.  Today things have changed drastically for a cheating spouse to find someone to be unfaithful with.  The internet is loaded with websites for cheaters to meet other cheaters.  If an unfaithful spouse isn’t that reckless, or is more particular with their search, they can go to numerous social media sites to find people they had known or had a relationships with in the past.  The most famous of which is Facebook.  People search for old boyfriends or girlfriends or maybe just someone they had never had a relationship with but would have liked to.  These old flames can be living anywhere, not just down the street, and the cheater can find them with ease.  Of course it’s easier to find a man because he normally doesn’t change his name when he gets married.  The women have overcome that problem by using their maiden name as a middle name so people can find them.  Some women don’t even use their married name at all.</p>

    <p>Finding someone to cheat with is just one way the internet has contributed to the increase in unfaithful spouses.  Technology has aided this behavior in other ways too.  Now people can communicate with ease at any time and from anywhere.  The smartphone is used by some not so smart people for cheating purposes.  They can text their paramour while you’re sitting right there in front of them.  They set up times and places to meet, they have guidance to places they’ve never been, they send loving or sexy messages and photos to each other. They text each other that they’re at the rendezvous and waiting.   The cheater uses their cell phone to call their faithful spouse and insure them that they are shopping or running errands when in fact they are with their cheating lover.  I’ve been a private investigator for several years in the Saint Louis metropolitan area and have seen the cheater call their spouse numerous times while holding hands with their lover.  If this technology were not available the number of cheaters would significantly be reduced.</p>

    <p>A cheating spouse uses these devices to help them in their unfaithful behavior but what they don’t realize is technology can also help expose and catch them red handed.  Technology has helped reduce the costs of an investigation considerably. A lot of the leg work required in the past can now be done on a computer.

    <p>I have just finished a case for a client who had originally hired one of those “large all-purpose Investigative firms”. They ended up charging him more for a mere 5 3/4hrs. of work than I charged him after solving his case. They provided him with no new information and did not achieve the results he wanted. If you’re having infidelity issues with your spouse or significant other give us a call at Stealth Private Investigations <a href="tel:+13143297151">314-329-7151</a>.</p>

  title: "Retainers"

    <p>As stated in PI Magazine,
    <blockquote>"It's common for private investigators to have clients sign a PI Retainer Agreement before commencing any investigation. A Retainer Agreement protects both the client and the investigator. It should clearly state what services the investigator is being hired to perform, at what rate, and detail all the terms and conditions pertaining to the investigation. The Retainer Fee represents the budget you have allocated for the investigation and investigators will usually never commence work without a retainer. The main product/service investigators provide is information. As such, the retainer allows for the investigator to provide the client with the information developed without fear of not getting paid."</blockquote>

  title: "Why Hire a Private Investigator?"

    <p>You may be asking yourself, "Why do I need to hire a PI or Private Investigator?"</p>
    <p>
      Private Investigators are very familiar with the art of undercover and surveillance work.  You may be putting yourself in danger if you try to perform your own investigation. Tailing and surveillance may put you in areas where it’s not safe at night or even in the day for that matter. You’re very likely to blow your cover, especially if you’re known by the person you’re surveilling. This too can be dangerous if that person is of a violent nature. If they notice you they can call the police and have you arrested for stalking. Private investigators aren’t arrested for stalking, that’s their job, and the law knows there’s no harm intended. You also have to know the laws, you can’t just go around videoing someone and expect it to hold up in court. Or if you got the video in an illegal way you may be the one that’s in court defending yourself. There are many other reasons why you need to hire a PI but I’ll get into them at a later time. Play it safe and hire a PI.

      Hiring a licensed private investigator is important for many reasons one of which is the CPE required by the state of Missouri for it's investigators. I have just finished my 16 hours of training for this time period. This year I restudied "Ethics" and "Surveillance".

      It’s wise to hire a PI for infidelity/adultery cases. Several of my clients have revealed their suspicions of infidelity to their partner making it much more difficult to find out what they are doing. Believe me, you cannot tail someone in your car without them seeing you or you getting a ticket. If you did happen to see who they are with you won’t be able to find out who that person is without giving yourself away. You won’t be able to get a background check on the person. I’ve had client’s locations and conversations monitored because their partner new they were under suspicion. This makes an investigation more difficult and expensive. The bottom line is, hire a PI to get the facts and put your mind at ease.

      PI Magazine just published an interesting article about online investigative sites. Clients were using them disrupting investigations and getting bogus information. They compared databases restricted to investigators with sites like <em>PeopleFinder</em>, <em>Intellius</em>, and <em>BeenVerified</em. The results were downright sad. One investigator found out his mother was still alive three years after he had buried her. It told a lot more but the bottom line is the online sites are not accurate. They can lead you down the wrong path and possibly cause you to make some wrong decisions.
